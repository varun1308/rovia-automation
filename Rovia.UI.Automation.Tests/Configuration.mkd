###LogManager

This section defines all the logging settings for the test run. Here we add Summaryloggers, Detail Loggers and define the severity settings.  
To add a logger we are required to provide an alias, its namespace, assembly name and it target (filepath in case of file loggers and console for console loggers).  
Severity values defines the extent of logging. Only those msgs which have a priority equal to or greater than the severity setting are logged.
